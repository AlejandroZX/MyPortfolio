            <h3>University of Central Florida</h3>
            <p><strong>Degree:</strong> Bachelor of Science in Mechanical Engineering</p>

    <!-- About Section -->
    <section id="about">
        <h2>About Me</h2>
        <p>I am a senior at the University of Central Florida, majoring in Mechanical Engineering. Throughout my academic career, I have taken advanced courses such as Heat Transfer, Machine Design, Solid Mechanics, and Structure of Materials Engineering. These classes have helped me build a strong foundation in engineering principles and problem-solving skills.In addition to my coursework, I have gained valuable hands-on experience through my work at Hoverfly Technologies and the WEAR Lab. These opportunities have allowed me to apply the theoretical knowledge from my classes to real-world engineering challenges. Through this combination of academic and practical experience, I have had the chance to work on several projects, many of which are highlighted in this portfolio.</p>

        <h2>Projects</h2>

        <!-- Project 1: Surface Modeling of Demo Model Gimbal -->
        <div class="project-card">
            <h3>Surface Modeling of Demo Model Gimbal - Hoverfly Tech.</h3>
            <div class="image-container">
                <img src="images/Gimbal" alt="Surface Modeling of Demo Model Gimbal">
                <img src="images/Gimbal2" alt="Surface Modeling of Demo Model Gimbal">
            </div>
            <p>Utilizing advanced surface modeling techniques, I successfully designed and manufactured six demonstration gimbals, which were subsequently integrated into a variety of drone platforms. The assembly process included testing and refinement, ensuring that each gimbal met quality and performance standards before deployment in real-world applications.</p>
        </div>

        <!-- Project 2: Keepout Area and Landing Leg Design -->
        <div class="project-card">
            <h3>Keepout Area and Curved Leg Design - Hoverfly Tech.</h3>
            <div class="image-container">
                <img src="images/keepout area" alt="Keepout Area and Curved Leg Design">
                <img src="images/Drone Leg" alt="Keepout Area and Curved Leg Design">
            </div>
            <p>I developed a custom keep-out area and redesigned the drone landing legs to accommodate a company-supplied gimbal. This process involved meticulous measurement of the distance between the drone's landing legs and the gimbal to ensure optimal integration and functionality. To facilitate clear communication and visualization of the design, I created a detailed assembly model incorporating all relevant components. This comprehensive approach allowed for effective collaboration with the company, demonstrating the enhanced drone configuration and its capabilities.</p>
        </div>

        <!-- Project 3: Shin and Calf Cuff Component -->
        <div class="project-card">
            <h3>Shin and Calf Cuff Component - WEAR Lab</h3>
            <div class="image-container">
                <img src="images/2D Design of Cuff.png" alt="Shin and Calf Cuff Component">
                <img src="images/CAD Cuff.png" alt="Shin and Calf Cuff Component">
            </div>
            <p>I created a detailed 2D drawing of the shin and calf cuff and took precise measurements of the bare wire to facilitate its integration into the design. This design enables a seamless connection between the lower limb and the upper limb of the suit. Following this, I developed the cuff in SolidWorks and 3D printed a prototype for testing.</p>
        </div>

        <!-- Project 4: Exosuit Ankle Component -->
        <div class="project-card">
            <h3>Ankle Component of Exosuit for WULL - WEAR Lab</h3>
            <div class="image-container">
                <img src="images/Wull Ankle.png" alt="Exosuit Ankle Component">
                <img src="images/Wull.png" alt="Exosuit Ankle Component">
            </div>
            <p>The process of designing and prototyping the ankle component of our exosuit is displayed above. I began by drafting a precise 2D blueprint, with each component measured using a caliper for accuracy. The redesigned 3D model incorporates an attached ratchet, allowing the bare wire to feed through and connect seamlessly with the rest of the suit.</p>
        </div>

        <!-- Project 5: CAD Car Drag and Air Flow -->
        <div class="project-card">
            <h3>CAD Car Drag and Air Flow Project - EML3303C</h3>
            <div class="image-container">
                <img src="images/windtunnel" alt="CAD Car Drag and Air Flow">
                <img src="images/CAD CAR.png" alt="CAD Car Drag and Air Flow">
            </div>
            <p>The image showcases the 3D-printed CAD model of a car designed for testing drag force and airflow dynamics in a wind tunnel. Drawing inspiration from the Tesla Cybertruck, the model was crafted using metallic additive manufacturing techniques to ensure precision and durability. The streamlined, aerodynamic shape is engineered to minimize drag, optimizing the vehicleâ€™s performance in wind conditions. To ensure stability during testing, the model is securely fastened in the wind tunnel using a paperclip, allowing for precise measurements of drag force and airflow characteristics.</p>
